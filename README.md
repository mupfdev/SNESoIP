## Introduction

The SNESoIP (SNES over IP) is an ethernet adapter for the Super Nintendo
Entertainment System which is also known as Super NES, SNES or Super
Nintendo.  It is basically an open-source, proof-of-concept, network
adapter to connect the SNES to the internet.

I'm not planning to build and/or sell these devices but the device
should be fairly easy to recreate.  Especially because I try to use
parts that are cheap and widely available.

I also highly recommend to use this project only in combination with a
flash cartridge like the [sd2snes](http://sd2snes.de/blog/) or the Super
Everdrive.

## Annotation

It's not the project's main goal to support existing SNES games.  It
rather provides the technology that can be used to develop custom
homebrew applications such as multi-user dungeons, bulletin board
systems, etc.
