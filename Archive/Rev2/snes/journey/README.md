# Journey #

_Journey_ is all about the _lonely wanderer_ whose destiny is to explore
his empty world and to be watched and directed by _others_.

Help him to find his way or just watch him succeed or fail.

The ROM can be compiled using the
[pvsneslib](https://code.google.com/p/pvsneslib/) development kit.
