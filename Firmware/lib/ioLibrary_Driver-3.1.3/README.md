#ioLibrary Driver
The ioLibrary means “Internet Offload Library” for WIZnet chip. It includes drivers and application protocols. 
The driver (ioLibrary) can be used for the application design of WIZnet TCP/IP chips as [W5500](http://wizwiki.net/wiki/doku.php?id=products:w5500:start), W5300, W5200 and W5100.

##ioLibrary
This driver provides the Berkeley Socket type APIs.

## How to add an ioLibrary in project through github site.
  - Example, refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt815RBGdsA
  - [ioLibrary Doxygen doument](https://github.com/Wiznet/ioLibrary_Driver/blob/master/Ethernet/SOCKET_APIs_V2.0.chm) : Refer to **TODO** in this document
    - Define what chip is used in **wizchip_conf.h**
    - Define what Host I/F mode is used in **wizchip_conf.h**
